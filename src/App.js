    description:
      "In todays workout we trained a delariva spider guard pass, where the person trying to pass the guard catches the spider guard leg and moves in its direction. He cleans the leg with his adjacent leg and proceeds to put the opponent's leg between his two legs, squeezing. Grips are changed to hip and collar grip. Then a backstep is performed, where the head of the attacker is placed on the belly of the opponent and the attacker's outer knee touches the ground. Then the hip touches the ground as well, while pulling with both hands. A hip escape is performed to get the legs out. Then the attacker advances to side control.",
